# bash-tools
Just a collection of bash (.sh) tools I've coded for Linux. You can use them by running the .sh file or adding them to your ~/.bashrc file

File naming conventions (IMPORTANT):

If the file just has a simple name, followed by .sh, you can run it or add it to ~/.bashrc
However, if it has a name like name-description-bashrc-code, with a .txt extension, then it 
will not work by just executing it: you'll have to add it to ~/.bashrc
